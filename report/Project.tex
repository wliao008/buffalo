I am grateful for my adviser Prof. Heliotis, whose insightful advice, guidance and support from the beginning not only enabled me to complete the project on time, but also led me to a better understanding of the subject area.

I am also grateful for Prof. Fluet and Prof. Kazemian for their invaluable feedback.

Last but not the least, I want to thank my wife Michelle, for all the support and encouragement during my years at school.
