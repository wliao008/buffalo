Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) is a paradigm that allows programmers to isolate and separate crosscutting concerns from their programs. The concept has not been widely adopted by modern languages; support in tooling such as Integrated Development Environment (IDE), is also rare. In this project, I designed and implemented Buffalo, an AOP framework to provide this capability for the .NET platform.

Buffalo performs Common Intermediate Language instruction set modification according to the aspects written by the developer with the help of the Mono Cecil library. Buffalo is .NET attribute based, which means developers with existing .NET skills will have little or no learning curve to get started. Buffalo will help increase developer productivity in many areas, such as unhandled exception catching, tracing and logging, and other areas.
