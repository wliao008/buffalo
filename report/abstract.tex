Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) is a paradigm that let programmer isolate and separate crosscutting concerns from their programs. The concept has not been widely adopted by modern languages; support in tooling such as Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is also rare. In this project I designed and implemented Buffalo, an AOP framework to provide this capability for the .NET platform.

Buffalo is implemented with the Mono Cecil library. It performs MSIL instruction set modification according to the aspects written by developer. Buffalo is entirely attribute based, which mean developers with existing .NET skills will have a low learning curve to get started. Buffalo will help increase developer productivity in many area such as unhandled exception catching, tracing and logging, and many other areas.
