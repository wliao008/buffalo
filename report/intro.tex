\chapter{Introduction}

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) languages have given programmers a lot of freedom in expressing themselves in Object Oriented Design. However, they are still lacking in some areas when it comes to particular software design decision such as cross-cutting concern~\cite{aop}.

In this project, a framework called "Buffalo" is designed and implemented to solve this type of problem on the .NET platform. Buffalo makes use of the .NET attribute system to weave aspect code to any targeted methods. The design and rationale of the framework is discussed in section 2. The implementation detail is given in section 3.

The result indicates that by using Buffalo, developers can separate cross-cutting concerns from the core of the program for easy maintenance, and ultimately be more productive. The analysis is discussed in section 4.

The report concludes in section 5 with the current project status. A set of planned future works is also discussed and what is learned from undergoing this project.

Buffalo comprises around 1,200 line of source codes. A user manual is included in Appendix A, which contains some usage examples on how the system works. Instructions is also included on how to integrate Buffalo with MS-Build.
