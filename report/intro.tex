Object Oriented Programming (OOP) languages have given programmers a lot of freedom in expressing themselves in Object Oriented Design. However, they are still lacking in some areas when it comes to particular software design decision such as cross-cutting concern~\cite{aop}.

In this project, we will try to solve this type of problem by designing and implementing a framework called ”Buffalo” for the .NET platform. Buffalo makes use of the .NET attribute system to weave aspect code to any targeted methods. In section 2 we will look at the design of the framework. In section 3 we will discuss how the implementation is carried out in more detail.

We will show that by using Buffalo developers can separate those concerns from the core of the program for easy maintenance, and ultimately be more productive. We will show the result of the analysis in section 4.

In section 5 we will conclude the report with the current project status. We will discuss what sort of future works are planned and what lessons I have learned from undergoing this project.
