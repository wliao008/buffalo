Buffalo is a fairly compact framework for the current functionality. The full source code is around 1,200 lines, which is fully included here. With optimization it could probably be reduced even more. Note the short listing entitled "buffalo/BuffaloAOP/Program.cs" at the end is the entire BuffaloAOP.exe program that kicks off the weaving.
