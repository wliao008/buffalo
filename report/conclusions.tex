\section{Current Status}

Buffalo is currently at version 0.2. It contains two types of aspect: MethodBoundaryAspect, where various execution points can be intercepted. And MethodAroundAspect, where a method can be completely replaced while preserving the option to call back into the original method.

\section{Future Work}

There are couple areas where Buffalo can be improved upon. Usability wise, currently there is no automatic setup program that install Buffalo onto userâ€™s computer and integrate into MS-Build System. Some manual steps are needed in order to provide a more seamless experience.

Functionality wise, when Buffalo does post compilation weaving it starts fresh each time, it would be interesting to see how incremental weaving can be used here.

\section{Lessons Learned}

While framework such as Buffalo mitigates the problem of cross-cutting concerns. Still, to efficiently tackle the root of the problem, compiler vendors have to actively embrace the AOP concept and support it in the their languages natively. 

Developers also have to understand the existant of such problems and solutions available to better educate themselves.

Only when the concept is widely understood and supported by both developers and vendors can there hope to begin eliminating such problems.
