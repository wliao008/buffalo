\chapter{Conclusions}
\section{Current Status}

Currently Buffalo is at version 0.1. It contains two types of aspect: MethodBoundaryAspect, where various execution points can be intercepted. And MethodAroundAspect, where a method can be completely replaced while preserving the option to call back into the original method.

\section{Future Work}

There are couple areas where Buffalo can be improved upon. Currently there is no automatic setup program that install Buffalo onto userâ€™s computer, and modify the various Microsoft.common.target file to hook into Microsoft Build System. To use Buffalo some manual steps needed in order to provide a more seamless experience.

Another idea that I am interested in is to inject new features into the assembly. Similar to the Introduction feature of AspectJ.

Incremental compilation is another area I hope to get more familiar with, currently if an assembly is hooked up to the MS-Build system, the weaving happens for each post build. It would be more efficient if incremental weaving is used somehow.

\section{Lessons Learned}

While working on Buffalo I learned a lot about designing API. I tried to follow the best practice on what to expose and what to hide from the user, making the API usage more simplified and consistent. I also have a better understanding of the overall Aspect Oriented Programming concepts and various implementations, and how I can make use of it to eliminate some of the cross-cutting concerns in my applications.
